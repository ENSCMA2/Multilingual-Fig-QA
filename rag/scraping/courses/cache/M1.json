The functional model is a natural generalization of algebra in which programs are formulas that describe the output of a computation in terms of its inputs---that is, as a function.  But instead of being confined to real- or complex-valued functions, the functional model extends the algebraic view to a very rich class of data types, including not only aggregates built up from other types, but also functions themselves as values.  This course is an introduction to programming that is focused on the central concepts of function and type.  One major theme is the interplay between inductive types, which are built up incrementally; recursive functions, which compute over inductive types by decomposition; and proof by structural induction, which is used to prove the correctness and time complexity of a recursive function.  Another major theme is the role of types in structuring large programs into separate modules, and the integration of imperative programming through the introduction of data types whose values may be altered during computation.    NOTE: students must achieve a C or better in order to use   this course to satisfy the pre-requisite for any subsequent Computer   Science course. David Khan will be teaching this course, Summer 22.

Because the course is based upon empirical research about professional academic writers, students will learn expert practices for authoring their own arguments that contribute to an existing community of authors. Because reading and writing are inseparable practices for academic writing, students will read a variety of texts so that they can explore and critically evaluate a single issue from multiple perspectives and from different disciplinary genres. Students will learn methods for summarizing, synthesizing, and analyzing arguments within that issue so that they may contribute an argument of their own.  The course is also geared toward helping students understand the requirements of advanced college-level writing. Our students are typically very accomplished readers and writers, and we are eager to push their accomplishments toward greater excellence. For this purpose, students will build upon their composing knowledge by reflecting and thinking strategically as they plan, write, and revise their own texts. Ultimately, they will develop critical reading, rhetorical and linguistic practices for analyzing and producing texts within the context of an academic community.

As custodians of this data, databases affect almost every aspect of our lives: education, employment, entertainment, tax, medical, commercial, to name a few. In the broader picture of information security, database security is a critical facet.  In this course, we will study how to work with and protect a database. What are the assets of an organization?  Traditionally one would consider people, equipment, intellectual property, infrastructure, land, and cash to be amongst the assets of an organization.  Over the past couple of decades, we have emerged into a data driven age with data becoming a pivotal asset. As the new cyber-currency, the successful operation of modern organizations relies on the effective use of data to drive sales and to enhance customer experience. Data collected and used by an organization can be broadly divided into two types (i) line of business or operational data and (ii) customer behavior or analytical data.  In the past, data management focused on line of business data.  For example, when a ride request is made to a ride sourcing company like Uber or Lyft, what data is needed to meet that request? When a purchase is made in a grocery store what is the flow of data during that transaction?  Line of business data is used to support the core business processes of the organization. Alternatively, based on the purchase patterns of a shopper or the volume or location of ride requests how can a grocery store or a ride sourcing company make their operation more effective? The answer to these questions is based on customer behavior data.  Whatever type of data it may be, operational or analytical, some fundamental questions are the same.
